# sql-challenge

In this challenge, I used skills learned from the Georgia Tech Data Analytics bootcamp to import CSVs into a SQL database. After the database was populated using the schemas in schemas.sql, I queried the database using the queries in queries.sql to get the necessary information for the project. 

## Bonus Analysis

For the bonus analysis, I used SQLalchemy in python to access the database and then created visualizations from the data.
